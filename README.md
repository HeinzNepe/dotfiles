# Dotfiles

These are the dotfiles I will be installing on different devices. Please note that this is more of a learning experience than it is for real use, so please bear this in mind.

Usage of this program is at your own risk, as it may or may not be finished.

My goal with this is that i will be able to get my zsh config and theme installed on new computers without having to go trough the tedius install process. Idealy i will be able to install some additional packages and make it nice.
